## <p style="text-align: center;"> An ASCII game for deviants. Also my cute little project. </p>

You can find description for skills in the Library. To be honest I'd recommend running the game on fullscreen, or atleast near fullscreen cos some of the graphics will require it. Also there are releases for Linux and Windows too.
