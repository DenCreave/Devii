## <p style="text-align: center;"> A game for deviants. Also my cute little project. </p>

You can find description for skills in the Library. To be honest I'd recommend using it on fullscreen, or atleast near fullscreen for some of the graphics. Also there are executeable files for windows and linux too in: 

* Devii/bin/Debug/net7.0/linux-x64/publish/Devii

and

* Devii/bin/Debug/net7.0/win-x64/publish/Devii.exe

Or you can just download the latest release version.
